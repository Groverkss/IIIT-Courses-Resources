**Have you completed studying this resource?**: Yes

**Remarks**: Really good to do from scratch if you have enough time. Some lectures are hard and take 2-3 views, not because they arent explained well but because they topics are hard to grasp at start. Assignments are really good and teach a lot. Dont get scared at the start since some starting lectures are hard but they teach a lot. 
If you are watching them for a particular topic, usually they require you to know the content of the previous lectures, but most of the time it is easily coverable from CLRS.

**Prequistics**: A good grasp on DSA. This course will test your skills in DSA. You should be prepared for mathematical proofs as there will be a lot of proving. Some parts also require you to know probablility, random variables. If you are not confident in mathematics, you can refer to MIT OCW 6.042J https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/ 6.046 assumes you have done this course well.

Course covers almost all the algo topics covered by Kannan and focuses more on rigorous analysis of them (For example, you can check out the lectures on Master Theorem or Union-Find DS for detailed explanation). His style is quite distinct and concise and you may find him better than Kannan. 
PS: The course doesn't cover Turing machines or complexity classes.
