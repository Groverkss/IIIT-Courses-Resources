**Have you completed studying this resource?**: Yes

**Your review of this resource**: Really well written book. Before each proof,
the author gives an intuitive explanation for the proof. While it is
recommended to read the proofs, you can skip over them for a first read.

**Resource Name**: Automata, Computability and Complexity

**Contributor (your) Name**: Alapan Chaudhuri

**Resource Links**: [Video Lectures](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp15/6.045/special/videos/index.html), [MIT OCW course details](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/index.htm)

**Have you completed studying this resource?**: No, covered partially.

**Your review of this resource**: Scott Aaronson covers basics of a lot of topics.
I love how he explains stuff. Arguably, these are some of the best resources on Automata 
Theory and Introductory Complexity Theory.
