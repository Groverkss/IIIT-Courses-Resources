# IIIT-Courses-Resources

Most courses at IIIT-H have much better resources available online
which people sometimes discover too late and then have less time
remaining to cover the content. 

Aim of this repo is to allow our juniors to be able to use the resources
that we are aware of to improve their learning experience.

## How to Contribute

To add any Advice/Course/Resource, go to issues and use the templates given
there.

Please specify the branch the course is related to. In case it is offered
to multiple branches, fill it as cse/csd or your own branch.
