# IIIT-Courses-Resources

Most courses at IIIT-H have much better resources available online
which people sometimes discover too late and then have less time
remaining to cover the content. 

Aim of this repo is to allow our juniors to be able to use the resources
that we are aware of to improve their learning experience.

## How to Contribute

Feel free to create a pull request to contribute! I check my emails daily and
will reply with suggestions or will directly merge it within 1 day at max. 

If you want to be anonymous, you can either create an anonymous account on
github and send it.

Some suggestions:

1. Please specify the branch the course is related to. In case it is offered
to multiple branches, fill it as cse/csd or your own branch.

1. You can use `add-course.py` to create a directory for that course with an
initialized template.
