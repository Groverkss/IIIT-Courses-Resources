# IIIT-Courses-Resources

Most courses at IIIT-H have much better resources to refer to online
which people usually discover before it's too late or have less time
remaining to cover the content. 

Aim of this repo is to allow our juniors to be able to use the resources
that we discovered too late.

## How to Contribute

To add any Advise/Course/Resource, go to issues and use the templates given
there to add a resource to the list. 

Please specify the branch the course is related to. In case it is offered
to multiple branches, fill it as cse/csd or your own branch.

## TODO
