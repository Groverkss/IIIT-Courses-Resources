**Have you completed studying this resource?:** I watched lectures 1 to 8 and lecture 12 and referenced the slides as and when needed.

**Your review of this resource:** The lecturers are extremely knowledgeable (they are the authors of an extremely well-written book after all) and the discussions between the students and the lecturer are often very insightful.


**Why do you think this resource will be useful for others?:**
The lectures by the IIIT instructor (in Spring 2020) were often lacking in clarity (even though the instructor tried to put effort) and the slides’ content was exactly the same as the content in the book ‘Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective’ by Bryant and O'hallaron and hence, classes are likely to be a waste of time. The book is extremely well-written and the lectures by Bryant and O’hallaron supplement the book pretty well. The discussions between the students and lecturer accompanied by the great content delivery in the lectures makes it well worth watching.
