### Remzi, OSTEP

**Resource Name**: Remzi Spring'18 and OSTEP

**Contributor (your) Name**: Shashwat Goel

**Resource Links**: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/

**Have you completed studying this resource?**: Lectures yes, book and homework no.

**Your review of this resource**: The lectures are great for an intuitive understanding

**Why do you think this resource will be useful for others?**: OSN course at IIIT uses a boring graduate textbook with a lot of detail. Since the teaching is poor, achieving clarity of concepts or finding the coursework interesting is almost impossible without learning elsewhere. Hence, using the intuitive lectures here and the conceptual easy-to-read book (OSTEP) can be useful to most.

**Have you completed studying this resource?**: Completed 6/8 sections

**Your review of this resource**: Video letures are lengthy but really good. The demos using wireshark and shell utilities in between lectures are really helpful in understanding the topics practically. Watching this course alone can be boring. Pick atleast one person along with you to watch as the topics can get hard to grasp at times and can become boring.

**Why do you think this resource will be useful for others?**: IIIT Prof tries to cover a very heavy book in less than a month time and usually is very theoretical with no history, reasons or demos (particularly this). This course is much better than trying to understand inclass lectures. Another thing worth mentioning is that i tried finding various resources to study networking from and found this to be the best one according to me.
