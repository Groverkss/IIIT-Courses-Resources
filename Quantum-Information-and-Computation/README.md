## General Advice

Follow [Nielson and Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf) chapter 2. That will be most of all you need. The course depends heavily on your understanding of Linear Algebra.

Sidenote: Weekly Quizzes generally have a high combined weightage, make sure not to mess them up.
