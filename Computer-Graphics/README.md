# Computer-Graphics

(Kunwar: A small warning. Computer Graphics is not something I have continued
working on.  Actual people working on graphics may have better resources. These
are the ones I used for my course and liked.)

## General Advise

**Author**: Kunwar Shaanjeet Singh Grover

**Advise**: I was confused why would I study OpenGL 3.3 when OpenGL 4.6 is out.
All version starting from OpenGL 3.3 add extra features without changing
OpenGL's core mechanics. Learning on any version with OpenGL 3.3+ will
introduce you to the same core concepts. 

## Resources

**Resource Name**: Learn OpenGL Book

**Contributor (your) Name**: Kunwar Shaanjeet Singh Grover

**Resource Links**: https://learnopengl.com/

**Have you completed studying this resource?**: Did first 3 sections (enough
for the course)

**Your review of this resource**: Great intro to OpenGL. You should be able to
easily pull together a working OpenGL program and know how to make it work
easily after this.

**Resource Name**: CMake tutorial

**Contributor (your) Name**: Kunwar Shaanjeet Singh Grover

**Resource Links**: https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/

**Have you completed studying this resource?**: Yes

**Your review of this resource**: Great resource to use the good parts of cmake

**Why do you think this resource will be useful for others?**: The course uses
cmake extensively for assignments and programming in general. Most people end
up hating CMake without understanding its power and expressibility. This
resource should help you appreciate the good parts of CMake. Especially if you
use an editor like Vim.

P.S. If you are using CMake, then try to use cmake modules (FindOpenGl,
FindGLM) for easier compilation. [Example usage of
FindGLM](https://github.com/Groverkss/NotAmongUs)

**Resource Name**: Tiny Renderer tutorial

**Contributor (your) Name**: Kunwar Shaanjeet Singh Grover

**Resource Links**: https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer

**Have you completed studying this resource?**: No, but want to.

**Why do you think this resource will be useful for others?**: This resource is
something unrelated to coursework. This will help you understand and appreciate
the beauty of how OpenGL works by writing a simplified clone. This course does
not cover how to write applications for OpenGL but instead shows how OpenGL
works.
